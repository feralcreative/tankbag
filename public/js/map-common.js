  // ring around a dot that has moved on is a claim about nowhere.

  // THE RADIUS IS COMPUTED BY THE CALLER and passed in meters. This file draws;
  // range-circle.js decides. That split is what keeps the arithmetic testable,
  // and it is the same arrangement route-shape.js has with the drag handles.
  //
  // A google.maps.Circle rather than a styled marker, because the radius is in
  // METERS and has to stay in meters: a fixed-pixel ring would grow and shrink
  // with the zoom and mean nothing at any of them. It is also what makes the
  // ring shrink at all — the radius IS the remaining fuel, so the drawing needs
  // no animation and no idea of how fast it should go.

  // A google.maps overlay takes a real color string, not a var() — the API
  // resolves nothing — so the tokens are read out of the compiled stylesheet
  // the same way dashboard.js reads its chart colors. Read lazily rather than
  // at load, because the theme can change under a page that is already open.
  //
  // EVERYTHING IN THE FUEL OVERLAY IS $stop RED — the ring, the E markers, the
  // closed stretch and the Range button that toggles them. Ziad's call,
  // 2026-08-31. The ring was brand blue on the reasoning that a distance is a
  // quantity rather than a verdict, which is true of the number and false of
  // the picture: a blue circle drawn around red markers on a red road reads as
  // a second, unrelated feature.
  //
  // THE MOMENT DOT STAYS BLUE, and that is the line. It marks where the rider
  // is, which is not a warning and is the one thing here that would still be
  // drawn if the group had no bike on file.

   * lines at half opacity is a difference the eye has to look for, and pointing at a row
   * has to answer "which road is that" instantly. Solid versus dashed is a

   *
   * The dashes live in `icons` on a polyline whose own stroke is invisible, so
