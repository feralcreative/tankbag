// A day is drawn as ONE polyline — the concatenated geometry of all its legs —
// so a drag gives back a vertex index into that flat path and nothing else. The
// map layer has no idea where one leg ends and the next begins. Turning that
// index back into "leg 3, between via 1 and via 2" is this file's whole job.
//
// Kept separate from map-common.js and builder.js because it is pure: no DOM,
// no google.maps, no state. test/route-shape.test.ts drives window.TBShape the
// same way twist-client.test.ts drives window.TBTwist. Getting an off-by-one
// wrong here bends a route around the wrong corner, which is exactly the kind
// of thing that should fail in a test rather than on a map.

  // sitting in the field says nothing about which. The rider sees a route that
  // does not match the hint they gave and has no way to tell why.

  // The fix is free, because the answer is already in hand: the routed geometry
  // IS the road Google chose, so projecting the dropped point onto it gives the
  // coordinate the router actually used. Nothing new is requested and no second
  // API is spoken — see the note in builder.js's computeLeg for why this runs
