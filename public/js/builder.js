  // button: the global rule in _survey.scss sets three colors and no padding,
  // radius or weight, and the one in _builder.scss that DOES set those is nested

  // reason the box is gone.
  // `prebuilt` is how a saved place enters the ride: stopFromPlace() has already
  // made the point, roles and durable details included, and this must not
  // discard it by minting a bare one. Every other caller passes nothing.
  // THE ONE CREATION PATH. A map click, either search arm, a saved place, the
  // home seed and a new day's inherited first point all land here, and they all
  // produce a POI — the kind is not a choice anybody makes at creation time any
  // more. Ziad's call, 2026-08-23.
  //
  // EXCEPT THE FIRST POINT OF A DAY, which is promoted on the spot and tagged
  // `start`. A day has to begin somewhere, the server still requires at least
  // one stop per day, and a rider who drops one pin and saves should get a day
  // that means something rather than a validation error. It is the only implicit
  // promotion in the app.

  // leg from the one before it, which is what makes a start plus one POI draw a
  // road — the report that changed this on 2026-08-24. Note the cost that comes
  // with it: adding a POI is a Routes request now, where it used to be free.

  // this tab is the part that is about the plan: assigning somebody to a group,
  // and taking somebody off the ride.

  // THE GROUP PICKER IS THE ONE PLACE ids AND uids MEET. Everything else in this
  // file holds a subgroup by uid, because the client mints those and the server

  // ACCEPTING A PROPOSAL PUTS THE MEETING POINT ON EVERY GROUP'S ROUTE, THE MAIN

  // already somewhere they ride — adding it explicitly is what turns it from a
  // coordinate the app suggested into a stop on their day, with a name, a dwell
  // and a row in the roadbook.
  //
  // It is one edit per group rather than the two the trunk-based version made.
  // That version added the point to the joining group's last day AND to the
  // first shared day, which only worked because a shared day was a precondition
  // of being offered anything — under #239 there is usually no shared day at
  // all, and requiring one is the loop this feature exists to break.
  //
  // IT IS INSERTED BEFORE EACH GROUP'S LAST POINT, not appended. The last point
  // is the destination everybody is riding to — it is what made the proposal
  // possible — so appending would route the group past the meeting point to the
  // destination and then back to it.
  //
  // THE MAIN GROUP IS PLACED BY DISTANCE AND EVERY OTHER GROUP BY POSITION.
  // Second-to-last was the rule for all of them until 2026-09-04, on the
  // reasoning that a day whose only points are the start and the destination is
  // the shape this feature asks for — true of a joining group and false of the
  // main one, whose day is the ride and routinely has stops all along it. There
  // the meet landed after every stop the rider had planned, hundreds of miles
  // past where it belonged in the order. `alongM` is threaded through the
  // response now and placeMeetOnMain walks the strand back to a day and a slot.
  //
  // A JOINING GROUP KEEPS THE POSITION RULE because there is nothing to measure:
  // `alongM` is a distance along the MAIN group's road, and a joining group
  // contributes a starting point and no road at all until this insert draws one.
  // Never before their first point, though — that is where they set off from.
  //
  // GOES THROUGH addPoint LIKE EVERY OTHER POINT. It splices the legs, asks the
  // router for the two it changed, re-renders and marks dirty — a meeting point
  // is not special once it exists, and a second path that placed one would be a
  // second path to keep in step with routing, undo and the map.
  //
  // The prebuilt carries `meet`, an existing waypoint role, which is where #67's
  // "meets become structural" lands. It is still only a LABEL: junctions()
  // derives the boundary from the day list and reads no role. A point arriving
  // with roles becomes a stop, which is right — a meeting point is somewhere you
  // unambiguously stop, and it wants a dwell.
  //
  // WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO IS CUT THE DAYS. Splitting each group's day
  // at the meet and folding the tails into one shared day is the tidier
  // structure and it is a separate piece of work: every group's route reaches the
  // meeting point after this, which is the part that changes the ride, and the
  // rider can split a day at any stop from the row menu when they want the
  // shared stretch to be its own day.

   * WHAT THE MAIN GROUP HAS THAT NOBODY ELSE DOES IS A ROUTE THE POINT WAS

   * say how far along it the meet is — and a day with stops already on it needs

   * up the road after every stop the rider had planned.
   *
   * THE STRAND, NOT THE GROUP'S OWN DAYS. `alongM` is measured along the same

   * shared one, in order — so the walk back has to use the same definition or

   *
   * THE TAIL IS UNTAGGED, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. A day with no subgroup is

   * others somehow join" into the structure #67 describes: one approach day per
   * group, then a shared day. `junctions()` derives a MEET at that boundary with

   *
   * IT GOES AFTER THE LAST APPROACH, NOT AFTER THE DAY IT WAS CUT FROM. Position
   * is order, and `strandOf` builds a group's strand as its own days plus every
   * SHARED one in position order — so a shared day sitting ahead of a joining
   * group's approach would put the ride home before the ride out. The main
   * group's day is routinely first in the list and the approaches are appended
   * after it, so the naive splice is wrong in the ordinary case rather than the
   * exotic one.
   *
   * IT STARTS AT THE ARRIVAL, NOT THE NEXT MORNING. `splitDayHere` seeds the

   * usually marking where they slept. This is the opposite: everybody meets and
   * rides on, so the shared day begins the moment the last of them is there.
   * With no arrival worked out — an undated ride — it is left undated too,

   *
   * ITS OWN UNDO STEP, for the same reason the departure sync has one: it lands

  // in the item list and the dispatch, which is what the `items` argument and
  // the per-host click handlers are for.
  //
  // BUILT ON OPEN, NEVER PER HOST, and that is a constraint rather than a
  // preference. The role picker already renders 17 buttons for every point —
  // 119 nodes at seven stops and 340 at twenty — and an eager menu per row would
  // repeat that mistake. One menu element exists at a time, for whichever host
  // asked.
  //
  // It is absolutely positioned inside its host, so opening it moves nothing: an
  // inline menu would push everything below it down, which is the jump the whole
  // panel redesign exists to remove. Both hosts therefore need
  // `position: relative` — .point-row and .day-head both have it.
  //
  // Move up / Move down are on the POINT menu only. They are not redundant with
  // the drag handle there, because .row-drag is aria-hidden and a drag handle
  // cannot be operated from a keyboard — they are also what still works if the
  // SortableJS CDN fails. A DAY's grip is a real <button> with arrow keys wired
