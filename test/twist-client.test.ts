// The client port of the twistiness metric must agree with the server's.

// There are two implementations on purpose — the server computes at save time,
// the builder needs a live figure while the rider is still editing — and two
// copies of a numeric algorithm drift silently. This is the thing that stops

//
// If this fails, the fix is to bring the two back into line, NOT to loosen the
// assertion. A tolerance here would defeat the entire point of the file.
