// The promise that src/maps/ride-time.ts agrees with public/js/ride-time.js.
//
// Two things are being tested and they are not the same thing:
//
//   1. The rule itself — that a leg with distance and no duration is estimated
//      from distance, that a leg with a duration keeps it, and that a leg with
//      neither is zero rather than a guess.
//   2. That the two implementations produce identical answers, the same
//      arrangement as twist-client.test.ts, duration.test.ts and
//      filename-client.test.ts. **If this fails, bring the two back into line
//      rather than loosening the assertion.**
//
// It matters more here than the file's size suggests. The server copy exists
// only because the dashboard's saddle-time figure sums every leg a rider owns,
// and the whole reason that figure was withheld until 2026-08-24 is that an
// undercount there is silent and flatters. A drift between these two would
// reintroduce exactly that: the builder's timeline saying one thing and the
// lifetime total saying another, with nothing raised.
