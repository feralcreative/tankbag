// Pure: no database, no Hono, no clock. `service.ts` is the query half, the same
// split as invites, survey, stats, access, friends, members, votes, subgroups,
// follows, comments and suggestions.
//
// THIS SUPERSEDES `days.subgroup_id` AS THE ANSWER TO "WHO RIDES THIS", and the
// reason is a shape subgroups could not hold. A route carried one subgroup or
// none, and a rider belonged to one subgroup for the whole ride — so "three
// riders join at Portland and one of them peels off at Eugene" had nowhere to
// live: those three share a group, and the group is what the route is tagged
// with. Ziad's call, 2026-09-06, after describing exactly that ride. The set of
// people riding together changes for reasons that have nothing to do with where
// anybody set off from, so the rider is the primitive and the group is not.
//
// **A GROUP IS NOT GONE AND MUST NOT BE REMOVED.** It still answers a different
// question — where does this lot set off from — which is what the meeting-point
// proposer reads, and it is still how a planner assigns several riders at once.
// What it stopped being is the thing that says who rides a route.

 * "everyone unless removed" because it is how a ride actually reads: you say who
 * joins and who leaves, and it stays that way until you say otherwise. On the
 * worked example — ride to Portland, a friend joins to Seattle, they peel off,
 * you carry on to Vancouver — that is two answers instead of four, and the two
 * are exactly the two junctions.
 *
 * **A ROUTE RIDDEN BY NOBODY IS NOT A THING ANYONE MEANS**, which is what makes
 * the absence unambiguous: there is no state that an empty explicit set would
 * express and an inherited one would not. An explicit set that arrives empty is
 * therefore treated as no answer at all rather than as an empty route.
 *
 * **DERIVED, NEVER STORED.** The same argument `junctions()` makes about meets
 * and splits: the resolved set changes every time a route is added, removed or
 * reordered, and a stored copy would be wrong the first time anybody dragged
 * one. It is also why this takes the roster as an argument rather than reading
 * it — adding a rider to the ride changes the answer for every inherited route,
 * and that has to happen without a write.
 *
 * `days` must be in position order; the caller owns that, the same way
 * `junctions()` does.
