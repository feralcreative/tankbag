// What a subgroup IS, in terms of the days it owns.
//
// Pure — a function of a day list and nothing else — so it is testable under the
// house rule that governs test/. The queries live in ./service.ts and the two
// harder derivations in ./schedule.ts and ./rendezvous.ts.
//
// THE WHOLE MODEL IN ONE PARAGRAPH. A ride's days are one dense sequence, as
// they always were. Each day carries a subgroup or null, and null means everyone
// rides it. A rider in subgroup S rides the SUBSEQUENCE of days whose subgroup
// is S or null, in position order. That is the entire representation: no second
// ordinal, no parallel numbering, no join table. Which days happen on the same
// calendar day is carried by `start_at`, which already existed.
//
// It was chosen over subgroup-membership-on-legs, which reads better in #67 and
// breaks a settled rule — a day is ONE ORDERED LIST of points, and two feeders
// cannot both start at position 0 of one list. See docs/decisions.md.

/** Only the fields these rules read, so a test does not have to build a whole
 *  row and a client can pass its own in-memory day straight in. */
