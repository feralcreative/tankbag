// PROPOSING A MEETING POINT: given a trunk route and a subgroup's origin, find
// somewhere sensible for them to join.
//
// @epim's idea, in #143 and now #67, and the thing that turns subgroups from
// bookkeeping into planning: the earlier scope only routed TO a meeting point
// the planner had already picked.
//
// PURE GEOMETRY, AND IT CALLS NO ROUTER. That is a cost decision and a design
// one. Ranking a few dozen candidates through the Routes API would be a Routes
// bill per keystroke on a proxied, cached, per-request SKU — and the proposal is
// a SUGGESTION the planner accepts or ignores, at which point the ordinary
// routing path draws the real road and every number here is replaced by a
// measured one. Straight-line distance is the right precision for "is this a
// sane place to meet"; it is the wrong precision for "how long will it take",
// and this module never claims the second.
//
// Everything here is therefore testable with no database, no network and no
// fixtures beyond a handful of coordinates.

  // silent unfairness #67 asks the app not to commit on the planner's behalf.

  // THE EARLIEST ACCEPTABLE MEETING POINT WINS, NOT THE CHEAPEST. Ziad's call,
  // 2026-09-03, and it reverses what the weights said an hour earlier. The point
  // of a group ride is to ride as a group, so the thing being minimized is the
  // distance covered APART; the divert is a limit on what that may cost
  // somebody, not the goal.
  //
  // MEASURED, BECAUSE THE OLD WEIGHTS WERE NOT OBVIOUSLY WRONG. On ride 34 —
  // Oakland to Bakersfield with a second group starting in Santa Cruz, which
  // sits west of the road — divert falls monotonically the further south the
  // meet is: 101 miles at Oakland, 25 near Los Banos, 2.4 near Bakersfield. So a
  // score led by divert always picked the LAST viable point and the two groups
  // rode 200 miles separately to a ride they were doing together. Choosing the
  // earliest instead unites them about ninety minutes sooner.
  //
  // `alongM` REPLACES the old `-sharedFraction * 5` rather than joining it:
  // shared fraction is `(total - along) / total`, so the two say the same thing
  // and keeping both would just double the weight of one term.
  //
  // THE CONSEQUENCE TO STATE RATHER THAN TREAT AS A BUG: an earliest-subject-to-
  // a-limit rule always lands near the limit, so `maxDivertMi` stops being a
  // guard against nonsense and becomes the actual dial. It has no control and
  // this is where it would need one.
  //
  // Divert survives at a TENTH of a mile per mile, which only ever separates
  // candidates that are nearly the same distance along — near-ties, where "and
  // it costs them less" is the right reason to prefer one. The approach angle
  // and the fuel bonus keep their weights; note the fuel bonus is now worth two
  // miles of ROUTE rather than two miles of detour, which is a smaller thumb
  // than it was and still enough to prefer a pump over a bare vertex beside it.
