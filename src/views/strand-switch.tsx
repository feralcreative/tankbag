// reads "Seattle approach" on the roadbook and gets everybody's days in the
// hand-off has been handed somebody else's morning at a fuel stop, which is the
// exact failure #67's per-rider export exists to prevent.
//
// Renders NOTHING on a ride with no subgroups, which is nearly every ride. That
// is the whole reason `strand.all` is on the object rather than being fetched
// here: one empty array, one early return, and every page keeps working exactly
// as it did.
import type { Strand } from '../subgroups/service'

/**
 * `base` is the page's own path, without a query string. Both callers have
 * other parameters — the hand-off has `?density` — so each link carries them
 * forward rather than this component knowing about them; `extra` is that.
