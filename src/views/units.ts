// Miles or kilometers, as a rider's own choice.
//
// A DISPLAY-TIME CONCERN AND NOTHING ELSE. The storage layer is already mixed
// and stays that way: `route_legs.distance_m` and `days.distance_m` are meters,
// `rides.total_miles` is a mileage cache, `days.twistiness_dpm` is degrees per
// mile. Nothing here migrates — every formatter converts at the point it prints.
//
// **ITS OWN AXIS, NOT DERIVED FROM THE DATE FORMAT**, and #150 asked for that to
// be decided deliberately rather than inherited. date-format.ts stores real
// locale tags so Intl can decide digit order and the 12-vs-24-hour clock
// together, and units look like the obvious sibling — but the two genuinely do
// not correlate. `en-GB` is a locale that writes 24/08/2026 and 16:00 AND
// measures road distance in miles; deriving units from it would hand every
// British rider kilometers they never asked for and give them no way back.
//
// So this is a second preference with a second column. What it deliberately does
// NOT do is invent a locale-shaped mechanism to sit alongside the first one: the
// members are the two systems, because that is the question being asked.
//
// FUEL AND VOLUME ARE NOT HERE, and their absence is deliberate rather than
// unfinished. A bike's range is stored in meters and typed in miles
// (src/bikes/policy.ts), so it follows this axis for free; liters-vs-gallons is a
// third question nothing in the app currently asks, and a member added here for
// it would be a member no formatter reads.
