// Which palette a rider sees, on two independent axes.
//
// A DISPLAY LAYER ONLY, exactly like src/views/date-format.ts, whose shape this
// follows. Nothing here touches storage or any rendered value: the two stored
// strings become two attributes on <html>, and style/_theme.scss does the rest.
//
// TWO AXES, NOT SIX NAMES, and that is the decision worth stating. **Theme** is
// about which signals a rider can distinguish — default, high contrast,
// colorblind. **Scheme** is about ambient light — system, light, dark. They are
// genuinely unrelated questions, and collapsing them into one list of six would
// ask a rider to hunt for "colorblind dark" in a flat menu.
//
// It also makes `system` expressible, which a single list cannot do: "follow the
// OS" is a statement about the scheme axis alone. **There is no OS signal for
// colorblindness**, so there is no equivalent member on the theme axis and its
// absence is not an oversight.
//
// WHY `system` HAS NO ATTRIBUTE. The server cannot know a reader's OS setting —
// no request header carries it — so `system` is rendered as the ABSENCE of
// data-scheme, and a `prefers-color-scheme` media query fills it in. That is why
// schemeAttr() returns null for it rather than the string 'system'. Stamping
// `data-scheme="system"` would match no rule and silently pin every such rider
// to light.
