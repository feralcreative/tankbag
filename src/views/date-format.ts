// How a date and a clock are written down, per rider.
//
// The problem this fixes: five server-rendered surfaces formatted dates with a
// hardcoded `'en-US'` — the roadbook's date and clock, the account page, and the
// dashboard's month labels and number grouping. The BUILDER was already correct
// and always has been, because `<input type="datetime-local">` renders in the
// viewer's own locale and hands back an ISO string regardless. So a rider outside
// the US planned a day in `24/08/2026` and printed a roadbook that said
// `08/24/2026` — the same product disagreeing with itself.
//
// A DISPLAY LAYER ONLY, exactly like src/maps/duration.ts, whose shape this
// follows. Nothing here touches storage: `days.start_at` stays a timestamp with
// an offset, `ride.json` stays ISO, and every export is untouched.
//
// THE MEMBERS ARE REAL LOCALE TAGS, and that is the one judgement call worth
// stating. The alternative was an abstract `mdy` / `dmy` / `ymd` enum, which
// would have fixed the digit order and left me formatting by hand. Passing a real
// tag to Intl means:
//
//   - the clock follows too, which an order-only enum cannot do: en-GB is a
//     24-hour locale, so a British rider gets 09:05 rather than 9:05 AM;
//   - month and weekday names come from the same source as the numbers;
//   - number grouping COULD come along, via fmtNumber below;
//   - adding a locale later is one enum member and no formatter changes.
//
// NUMBER GROUPING IS NOT WIRED UP YET, and deliberately. `fmtMiles` and
// `fmtCount` in src/stats/shape.ts still carry a hardcoded 'en-US', because all
// three members shipped here are English and group identically as 1,234 — so
// threading a format through ten call sites in a pure module would change nothing
// anyone can see. `fmtNumber` exists for the day a member like `de-DE` (1.234)
// lands, which is when that churn starts buying something.
//
// THREE MEMBERS, ONE PER DIGIT ORDER, not a catalog of locales. Verified
// against Intl rather than assumed:
//
//   en-US  8/24/2026    Monday, August 24    9:05 AM
//   en-GB  24/08/2026   Monday 24 August     09:05
//   en-CA  2026-08-24   Monday, August 24    9:05 a.m.
//
// TRANSLATION IS NOT IN SCOPE and this does not pretend otherwise. All three
// members render English words, because the app has no i18n framework and a date
// preference is not one. A rider in Berlin gets their date order and the word
// "August".
