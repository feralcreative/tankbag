/**
 * Reconciles a ride's private stop details against the payload just written.
 *
 * This runs AFTER the day loop and outside it, and both matter.
 *
 * `point_details` is keyed by `(ride_id, uid)` and cascades from `rides`, not
 * from `days` — so the `delete(days)` that opens every save does NOT take it
 * with it, which is the whole reason a stop's confirmation number survives a
 * save at all. The flip side is that nothing else cleans it up: a stop the rider
 * deleted leaves its details behind forever unless this removes them. Hence the
 * delete-what-is-no-longer-here pass.
 *
 * A stop with no details at all writes no row rather than a row of nulls, so the
 * table holds only stops a rider actually filled something in for.
