// Stored originals are kept brotli-compressed on disk.
//
// WHY BROTLI AND NOT GZIP. Measured on a real 8-day GPX import in `storage/`:
// 834,594 B raw, 115,046 B at gzip -9, 59,895 B at brotli q11 — 7.3x against
// 13.9x. Both codecs are in Node core, so the better ratio costs nothing but the
// compression time, and that is paid once at import rather than on every read.
// An imported GPX is the most compressible thing this app stores.
//
// WHY THE `.br` SUFFIX IS NOT OPTIONAL. Gzip has magic bytes (1f 8b) and could
// therefore be sniffed out of a file still called `50-6.gpx`. **Brotli has no
// magic number at all** — there is no reliable way to look at a byte stream and
// say whether it is brotli or the XML it compresses. So the name has to carry
// it, which also means a half-migrated directory can be read at a glance.
//
// QUOTA ACCOUNTING IS UNAFFECTED AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. `kml_bytes`,
// `gpx_bytes` and `source_bytes` keep meaning the size of the original AS THE
// RIDER UPLOADED IT — an allowance must not depend on how well someone's file
// happened to compress. The consequence to state rather than treat as a bug:
// `rides.size_bytes` no longer describes bytes on disk. "How much disk are we
// using" is a `du`, not a query, and there is deliberately no second column.
//
// ASYNC, NOT THE SYNC VARIANTS. Brotli at quality 11 takes a few hundred
// milliseconds on a megabyte, and every compression here happens inside a
// request. brotliCompressSync would block the event loop for the whole import.
