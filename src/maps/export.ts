 * The ride as something to consume: GPX, KML, the roadbook, the hand-off page,

 * Every caller — the four serializers, the roadbook, the hand-off page, the zip
 * and the account export — wants the ride a rider is going to ride, not the
 * options they weighed. Filtering in the loader rather than in each of them
 * means the next caller cannot forget, which is the failure this codebase has
 * had before with byte columns and with the day cap.
 *
 * A GPX/KML/CSV/GeoJSON round trip therefore DROPS the alternates, deliberately.
 * None of those formats can express "this is an option", so a re-import would
 * silently promote every losing alternate to a real day and hand the rider a
 * ride with twice the mileage. Losing them is the smaller lie. The lossless path
 * is the native JSON, which goes through loadNativeRide below and keeps
 * everything.
 *
 * ONE SUBGROUP AT A TIME, when asked. `subgroupId` narrows the ride to the days
 * that rider actually rides — their own approach plus every shared day — which
 * is #67's per-rider hand-off in one argument. It is a SECOND filter stacked on
 * the alternates one, applied after it, and the order does not matter because a
 * losing alternate on a feeder day is dropped by either.
 *
 * `undefined` means the whole ride and is what every existing caller passes by
 * omission. `null` is NOT the same thing: it means "the trunk", the days
 * everybody rides, which is what a rider in no subgroup gets — see strandOf.

// keeps the points but the importer rebuilds one day out of many. This is the
// builder's own save payload, so a ride exported here and imported back is the
// same ride — days, colors, times, via points and all — because it goes
// through the same schema and the same insert the builder's save does.
//
// The version key is a version, not decoration: the importer refuses a file
// without one rather than guessing, which is also what keeps a plain GeoJSON
// from being mistaken for one.
//
// Version 2 (2026-08-09) renamed the ride's `routes` array to `days`, following
// the table. Version 3 (2026-08-11) renamed the version key itself from
// `tankbag` to `routeloop` with the product. Version 4 (2026-08-23) merged each
// day's `stops` and `pois` into one ordered `points` array, following the
// schema — a point is created as a POI and promoted later, so the kind became a
// flag on an element rather than a choice of which array to put it in.
//
// Version 5 (2026-08-24) is the first bump that is not a rename. A POI became
// part of the route, so a day carries `points - 1` legs where every version
// before it carried `stops - 1`. The shape of the file is unchanged; the
// INVARIANT is not, which is exactly the kind of change a version key is for —
// nothing about a v4 file looks wrong, it just has too few legs, and daySchema
// would refuse the whole import with no way for a rider to tell why.
//

 * name kept alive forever by accident, which is the thing that rename was
 * undoing. Same reasoning for the stops/pois merge below.
 *
 * v3 and earlier carried each day's points as two arrays. They are concatenated
 * STOPS FIRST, which is the order those files were written in and the order the
 * builder displayed them in: a v3 file's POIs had no stored order at all, so
 * there is no sequence to recover and appending them is the only honest reading.
 * The kind is stamped explicitly rather than left to the schema default, because
 * a v3 stop must not silently become a POI.
 *
 * v3 also changed only the envelope's version key, which `nativeVersion` already
 * absorbs, so there is nothing else to do about it.
 *
 * v4 and earlier carried `stops - 1` legs, because a POI anchored none. A day
 * needs `points - 1` now, so every day's legs are re-cut from its own track at
 * every point — see relegDay. Nothing is re-routed and no coordinate is invented;
 * the concatenated geometry is unchanged. A day the file left with no legs at all
 * (a CSV import, which has no line to cut) stays that way and the builder fills
 * it with straight placeholders on load, exactly as it did before.
