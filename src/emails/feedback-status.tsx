// "Here's what happened to the thing you told us."
//
// The message that closes the loop. Before this, a rider who reported something
// found out what came of it by remembering to check /feedback/mine, which nobody
// does — so from their side every report vanished into a form, which is exactly
// the experience that stops people reporting anything a second time.
//
// **The copy is not written here.** Every label and sub-line comes from
// STATUS_META in src/feedback/policy.ts, which is the single source for the
// words a rider reads and is pinned exhaustively by
// test/feedback-status-labels.test.ts. Restating any of it in this file would
// create a second place for "we're not doing this one" to be phrased, and the
// two would drift on the first edit.
//
// The rider's own words are quoted back so the message stands alone in an inbox
// three weeks later. Untrusted, escaped by JSX.
