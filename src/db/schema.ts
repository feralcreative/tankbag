// changes for reasons that have nothing to do with where anybody set off from.
//
// SO THE PRIMITIVE IS THE RIDER, NOT THE GROUP. A group survives as a convenience
// for assigning several riders at once and as the thing a meeting point is
// proposed FOR — it still answers "where does this lot set off from" — but it is
// no longer what says who rides a route.
