// Dev seed: one user + the sample ride, structured rows extracted from a real
// KML — so dev exercises the same rows the import pipeline and the builder
// produce, rather than synthetic geometry that cannot reproduce an import bug.
//
// WHERE THE KML COMES FROM, and why there are two answers.
//
// The good one is the rider's own storage: owner 1, ride 1, which is what the
// ids come out as after the TRUNCATE below RESTARTs IDENTITY. That is a real
// 185-mile import and by far the better dev dataset.
//
// It is also GITIGNORED, so it is not there on a fresh clone, on CI, or on a
// second machine whose storage has not synced — and this used to be a hardcoded
// relative `storage/1/1.kml` that ignored STORAGE_PATH entirely. When the file
// was missing the failure was a bare ENOENT from readFile, thrown AFTER the
// TRUNCATE had already run, so the seed emptied the database and then died. That
// is how it was actually met: the path was stale after the project moved, and
// the reported symptom was `npm run dev` failing with no usable error.
//
// So: ask the storage layer for the path rather than building one, and fall back
// to the committed fixture when it is not there. The fixture is a small ride
// rather than a good one, so this says which it used.
