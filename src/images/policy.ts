// What the app will accept as an uploaded image, decided from the BYTES.
//
// Pure — no sharp, no filesystem — so test/images.test.ts can pin the security
// boundary with no fixtures beyond a handful of byte arrays. The half that
// actually decodes lives in ./process.ts.
//
// THIS IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, NOT A FORMAT PREFERENCE. Three rules, and #99
// argued each of them before this file existed:
//
//   1. NEVER TRUST THE EXTENSION OR THE Content-Type. Both are supplied by the
//      client and neither describes the bytes. `sniffImageType` reads the magic
//      number and nothing else.
//   2. RASTER ONLY. NO SVG, EVER. An SVG is a document that can carry script,
//      and an uploaded one served back to a browser is stored XSS. It is refused
//      here by construction rather than by a rule someone has to remember: an
//      SVG is text and matches no magic number below.
//   3. THE SIZE GATE COMES BEFORE ANY DECODE. Decoding is where a malicious
//      image does its work, so a file over the cap is refused without ever being
//      handed to a decoder.

/** Formats accepted on the way IN. Everything is re-encoded to one format on the
 *  way out, so this list is about what we are willing to decode.
 *
 *  PNG AND JPEG ONLY, carried over from #99's decision. Worth knowing what it
 *  costs: an Android phone that hands over a WebP, or an iPhone with HEIC
 *  passthrough, is refused. Widening it is a one-line change here plus a test —
 *  the re-encode downstream makes the extra formats no less safe — but it is a
 *  decision rather than an oversight. */
