// Raw aggregate rows in, everything the dashboard renders out.
//
// Same split as src/survey/score.ts and for the same reason: query.ts holds the
// SQL and cannot be tested here, so every judgment that could be WRONG rather
// than merely absent lives in this file, where vitest can pin it without a
// database.
//
// Three of those judgments are not obvious and each has cost someone a
// afternoon somewhere:
//
//   - Twistiness rolls up DISTANCE-WEIGHTED, never as an average of averages.
//   - A null twistiness is "not measured", never "Straight".
//   - Saddle time is reported, and part of it is an estimate that says so.
//
// THE LAST ONE REVERSED ON 2026-08-24 and the old reasoning is worth keeping,
// because it was right about the danger and wrong about the remedy. There was no
// "hours in the saddle" figure at all, on the grounds that the import path never
// writes a leg duration — so a lifetime total would undercount by however much
// of the library was imported, silently, and in the FLATTERING direction, which
// is the kind of wrong nobody reports. The remedy taken was to estimate the
// missing legs from distance at a nominal speed (src/maps/ride-time.ts), which
// is what both clients already do, rather than to keep the figure off the page.
// `SaddleTime.estimated` is the part that keeps it honest: the total covers
// everything, and the page says when some of it was figured rather than measured.
