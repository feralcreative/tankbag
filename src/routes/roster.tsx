// The roster: who is on a ride, what they said, and how they vote.
//
// ONE PAGE PER RIDE at /m/:slug/riders, and it is still where every verb lives.
// The reason has not changed and is not about space: a rider who is NOT the
// owner has no builder to open and still needs somewhere to RSVP and vote, and
// most of what is here is a statement BY a rider rather than a decision by the
// planner.
//
// THE BUILDER HAS A RIDERS TAB AS OF 2026-08-26 and it is not a second copy of
// this page — see the JSON block at the foot of this file. It reads the roster
// and carries the two verbs that are about the PLAN (which approach a rider is
// on, and taking somebody off the ride); both call the same service functions
// the forms below do, so no gate is decided twice.
//
// SERVER-RENDERED FORMS for everything on the page itself — the same choice
// /trash and /friends made and for the same reason. Every verb here is one
// button press with no state to keep in sync, and a redirect back to the page is
// the interaction.
//
// The rules are src/members/policy.ts and src/votes/policy.ts. Nothing in this
// file decides whether a verb is allowed; it decides what to show.
