// this route already asks a HARDER question: `requireActiveApi` means an
// account Ziad personally approved, and `requireSameOrigin` means the request
// came from the site. A bot holding both is not stopped by a checkbox. The

// If a bot check is ever wanted here, the answer is rate limiting (#16), not a
// widget: a token is single-use and expires in five minutes, so it cannot ride

// comment on a stop, a photo attached to one. **Any feature that needs a point
// to keep its identity has to fix this first**, and the fix is not small: send
// ids in the payload, diff here, and update in place, which rewrites
// insertRideGraph, ridePayload and loadRidePayload — the path the native JSON
// import shares. Do not add the reference and hope; the failure is silent and
// looks like data that wandered off.

/**
 * ONE DAY, for a builder catching up on somebody else's save.
 *
 * A change notice carries a day uid and its new hash; this is what the client
 * fetches to act on it. A refetch of the whole ride would be the obvious
 * alternative and is not viable at editing speed: the body limit is 8 MB, the
 * ceilings are 31 days and 400 points, and leg geometry dominates — so a save
 * every three seconds would move megabytes per notice, per watcher.
 *
 * Broadcasting the day over SSE instead has the same problem pointed the other
 * way, and would put a rider's stop details into a channel every member of the
 * ride is subscribed to.
 *
 * Built by picking out of loadRidePayload rather than by a query of its own.
 * That is deliberate and costs a little work on a rare path: a second day
 * serializer would drift from the first, and the drift would surface as days
 * quietly losing fields only when they arrive over the live channel — which is
 * the hardest possible place to notice it.

  // a flat run of divs and nothing said whether a given control changed one day
  // or the whole ride — the day scrubber sat next to the day's own color
  // picker, and the ride timeline sat between two day-level blocks.
  //
  // THE RIDE TIMELINE IS NO LONGER IN HERE. It moved to a bar across the bottom
  // edge of the map on 2026-08-15 — see rideTimeline() in src/views/layout.tsx
  // and .map-timeline in style/_map.scss. What is left in the second ride band is
  // the day scrubber alone, and the two are not the same control: the scrubber
  // picks which day you are EDITING and belongs beside the edit controls, the
  // timeline moves through what you are LOOKING AT and belongs over the map.
  // That split is what issue #93 asked for.
  //
  // THERE IS NO SAVE BUTTON, and no Discard either. The builder autosaves on
  // idle — see the autosave block in public/js/builder.js for the timing and for
  // the two conditions that hold a flush. What is left in .builder-actions is
  // undo, redo, a status readout and the link to the public page.
  //
  // Two details in that row are load-bearing rather than cosmetic, both serving
  // the rule that nothing in the panel changes size as its value changes:
  //
  //   #save-status is aria-hidden and #save-announce below it is the live
  //   region. A polite region on the readout itself would say "Unsaved changes,
  //   Saving, Saved" aloud on every edit burst — three announcements a minute
  //   for something a sighted rider takes in peripherally. The live region
  //   speaks only for an error or a blocked save, which are the states that
  //   need acting on. Its width is fixed in _builder.scss for the same reason.
  //
  //   #view-link ships from first paint and is revealed by the first successful
  //   save, using visibility rather than the hidden attribute. An element that
  //   appeared would shove the status beside it, which is the exact jump this
  //   whole epic is about.
  // THREE TABS, and the ride's own fields above them. Adding riders and groups
  // to a panel that was already the densest surface in the app turned it into a
  // scroll: the day list, the subgroup editor and a link to the roster all
  // stacked in one column, with the day you were editing pushed below the fold
  // by a feature about people. Splitting it means only one of the three is ever
  // paying for vertical space.
  //
  // WHAT IS ABOVE THE STRIP BELONGS TO THE RIDE, not to any tab: the description
  // and the visibility select. Putting them inside Routes would have said they
  // were about the route, which visibility in particular is not — it is the
  // single most consequential control in the panel and it governs the whole
  // package. They cost every tab a couple of lines, which is the trade.
  //
  // DELETE IS BELOW THE PANELS, not above the strip with the other two ride-level
  // controls and not in any tab. Same reasoning it has always had: a destructive
  // control wants distance from the rows a pointer lives in, and directly under
  // the ride's name is the least distance available.
  //
  // The strip is buttons with role="tab", not links and not a <details> each.
  // Links would need a URL per tab and the builder has one page with unsaved
  // state in it; three disclosures would let a rider open all three and be back
  // where they started. Roving tabindex, arrow keys and aria-selected are wired
  // by initTabs() in builder.js — nothing here is decorative.
