// Who is on which stretch of road, over HTTP.

// The rules are `src/day-riders/policy.ts` and the queries `src/riders/service.ts`;

//
// TWO ROUTES AND NOT ONE PER RIDER. Membership is a per-ROUTE fact — "these
// people are on this stretch" — so the unit of a write is a route's whole set,
// which is also what makes an empty list mean "go back to inheriting" rather
// than "this route has nobody on it". A per-rider toggle would need a third
// state to say that and there is nowhere to put it.
//
// SCOPED UNDER /api/rides/:id/route-riders RATHER THAN /api/rides/:id/routes/…
// deliberately: `GET /api/rides/:id` already swallows any `/api/rides/<word>`
// added later, and a nested `:uid` under a segment that reads like a collection
// is one reorder away from the same trap. See the filename.ts gotcha.

 * a stretch is planning, which is what an edit-level member is trusted with —
 * the same trust that lets them move a stop. It is not the roster: nobody is
