// The whole computation is `src/subgroups/rendezvous.ts`, which is pure and

// from a ride that is being edited.
//
// ONE PRESS, ONE ANSWER PER JOINING GROUP. Ziad's call, 2026-09-04. The button
// stays single — that half of #239 was right and is not being reopened — but a
// press now answers the whole question rather than a blended version of it: each
// satellite gets its own candidates on the main group's road, and the planner
// knocks the decisions down one at a time, main + group 2, main + group 3, and
// so on. A satellite JOINS the main ride and becomes part of it.
//
// What #239 actually settled is still settled and is what makes this possible:
// the main group's road is THE road, so there is no spine to nominate and no
// group can come back as the one asked to divert. A blended proposal was the
// part that did not survive contact with three groups — it answered with points
// that suited everybody on average and nobody in particular, and the panel could
// not say which group any of it was for.
//
// THE BILL IS A TOTAL, NOT A PER-GROUP RATE. Ziad's call, 2026-09-04: every
// joining group costs its own Routes requests, so an unbudgeted press on a
// nine-group ride is 36 of them. ROUTED_BUDGET and ANCHOR_BUDGET are divided by
// the group count instead, so the spend is flat whatever the ride looks like and
// a big ride buys fewer candidates each rather than a bigger bill.
//
// THE MAIN GROUP'S ROAD IS THE ROAD. `rides.primary_subgroup_id` already means
// the main group and already defaults to the first one created, so there is
// nothing to nominate — and the main group is passed to the proposer as its own
// argument, so it can never come back as the group being asked to divert.
//
// A POST rather than a GET although it reads and writes nothing, and that is
// deliberate: it is behind requireSameOrigin like every other write-shaped call
// in the builder, and a GET would be cached by something.
