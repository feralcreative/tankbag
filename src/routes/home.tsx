// THE DASHBOARD, at `/`. This is the page with the numbers on it: hero miles,
// tiles, the storage meter, the twist rollup, role bars, the twelve-month chart.
//
// AND THE RIDER'S OWN RIDES, since 2026-08-24. That is the second time this page
// has held a list and the two are not the same mistake, so the history matters.
//
// It was once the first ten of your rides beside the first ten popular public
// ones — a ride list with a copy of /explore?sort=popular bolted on. Splitting
// that out to /rides in August fixed the /explore half and left the other: `/`
// kept a six-ride "picking up where you left off" strip, so the nav still had two
// doors onto a rider's own rides. Ziad's call on 2026-08-24, answering the third
// of #103's four open questions: one door. /rides 302s here and the full list
// sits under the stats.
//
// The list is CAPPED at RIDE_PAGE with `?rides=all` to lift it. The page it
// absorbed was unpaginated, and an unbounded list hanging under eight blocks of
// stats gets worse the more a rider uses the app.
//
// Naming, because it has confused everyone including its own author: the file
// is `home.tsx` and the route is `/`, but `public/js/dashboard.js` and
// `style/_dashboard.scss` are BOTH THIS PAGE'S. They are named for what the page
// is rather than for what the file is called, and they were the honest names even
// while `src/routes/rides.tsx` held the list. That file is now a redirect.
//
// EVERY NUMBER HERE IS RENDERED SERVER-SIDE AS TEXT. The one chart is progressive
// enhancement over a table that is already correct without it — the roadbook and
// the hand-off pages set that precedent deliberately, and a stats page that goes
// blank without script would be the first thing in the app to do so.
//
// Saddle time IS reported here as of 2026-08-24, and it used to be the one thing
// this page deliberately withheld: the import path writes no leg duration, so a
// lifetime "hours in the saddle" undercounted by however much of the library was
// imported — silently, and in the flattering direction. It is estimated from
// distance now, the same way both clients estimate an unrouted leg, and the hero
// says when part of the figure was figured rather than measured. See
// src/maps/ride-time.ts and src/stats/shape.ts.

// Deliberately not views/cards.tsx's own Card: this one carries a visibility pill
// and an edit link that the public card must never show. Same shape, different
// contract — merging them would mean a flag that only ever means "am I the
// owner", which is the thing the two separate components already say.
//
// What IS shared is CardFace, the picture-or-color-block, because that part has
// no contract of its own. It is also the part with the traps in it — the `?v=`
// immutability hash, the lazy loading, the source dimensions that keep the grid
// from reflowing — and those had already been copied once.
//
// Moved here from src/routes/rides.tsx on 2026-08-24 when that page folded into
// this one. Became a card on 2026-08-25 with the rest of them (#135).
//
// THE EDIT LINK AND THE PILL SIT OUTSIDE THE ANCHOR, and that is not a layout
// preference: an <a> inside an <a> is invalid HTML and browsers recover from it
// by closing the outer one early, which silently drops half the card out of the
// link. The foot is a sibling of the link, and the card's own padding is what
// makes the two read as one object.
// A ride the viewer is ON but does not own.
//
// A THIRD CARD RATHER THAN A FLAG ON THE OTHER TWO, for the same reason
// OwnRideCard is not views/cards.tsx's Card: the contract is different. There is
// no visibility pill, because the setting is not this rider's to know or change;
// there is no edit link, because they cannot; and there is an RSVP, which
// neither of the others has anywhere to put. A flag meaning "am I the owner"
// plus a flag meaning "am I a member" is two booleans encoding three cards.
//
// No color block: `ridesImOn` does not join days, and a fourth query per
// dashboard render to tint a short list is not worth it. CardFace draws the
// thumbnail when there is one and a neutral field when there is not.

            that did not begin with opening a menu.

            ONE CTA, NOT TWO. A second copy beside the ride list further down
            would compete with this one and turn the page's most prominent
            control into a repeated motif.

            NOT IN THE EMPTY STATE, and not missing from it either — a rider with
            no rides gets FirstRun instead of this whole branch, and that panel

            THREE TABS: the rider's own rides, their friends', and everyone's.
            Ziad's call, 2026-08-26. One strip rather than three stacked sections
            because they answer the same question about three audiences, and a
            dashboard that ran all three at full length would be a page nobody
            reaches the bottom of.

            RIDING WITH OTHERS IS NOT ONE OF THEM and stays above — see the note
            on it. It is a different question: membership, not visibility.

            The behavior is public/js/tabs.js, shared with the builder's panel.
            `data-tabs` is the auto-wiring hook, so this strip needs no code of
            its own. It also means the page WORKS WITH JAVASCRIPT OFF, just not
            as a tab strip: every panel below is rendered, and only the two that
            are `hidden` are hidden — a rider with no JS sees the first list and
            can still reach /explore and /friends from the nav. That is the same
            bargain the chart makes two blocks up.

              A HEADING ABOVE THE STRIP, because the tabs replaced one — this
              block used to be `<h2>Your rides</h2>` and a list, and converting it
              to tabs took the only thing naming the section with it. Every other
              block on the page has an h2 and this one looked like it had lost
              one.

              It names the SECTION and the tabs name the audiences, which is why
              it is "Rides" and not "Your rides": that phrase is now the first
              tab's label, and a heading repeating its own first tab reads as a
              mistake.

              The tablist keeps its own aria-label rather than being labelled by
              this heading. They are two different things to a screen reader —
              the section is "Rides" and the control inside it is a tab list —
              and aria-labelledby here would announce the heading twice.
