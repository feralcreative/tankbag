// The printable roadbook (#25) — the sheet a rider tapes to the tank bag.
//
// **This is a stop-by-stop roadbook, not a turn-by-turn cue sheet, and that is
// a limit of the data rather than a choice.** `route_legs` stores geometry,
// distance and duration and nothing else; maneuvers are a separate field on the
// Directions response, they are what the call is priced on, and they would be
// blank for every imported ride regardless. Printing "turn left in 0.4 mi"
// would mean re-requesting every leg with a wider field mask at print time.
//
// What a rider actually needs taped to a tank bag is the thing this can answer
// honestly: where the stops are, how far apart, how far since the last fuel,
// and what time you should be there. That is a roadbook. It is what rally
// riders carry and it does not go stale when a road closes.
//
// No JavaScript. It is a page you print.
