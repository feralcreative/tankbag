// The Google Maps hand-off (#66) — the page that gets a planned ride into the
// thing the rider actually navigates with.
//
// Most riders are on a phone, not a dedicated unit, so this is the hand-off
// that matters most. Google Maps takes nine waypoints per link, which is the
// constraint everything here is shaped by: a day becomes an ordered series of
// links rather than one, and holding the route to the roads it was planned on
// is paid for in links rather than in points per link.
//
// The number this page refuses to hide is the longest unpinned stretch. Between
// two consecutive points Maps routes however it likes, so a day handed over as
// six stops leaves it twenty-odd miles of freedom at the worst point. Saying so
// is the difference between this and every tool that claims a clean hand-off
// and delivers a route that wandered.
//
// No JavaScript beyond the density links, which are plain hrefs — a page that
// has to work on a phone at a fuel stop with one bar should not need a bundle.

                Stops arrive as pins rather than names. The coordinates are exact; Google only shows a name for a place
